## 🧠 What is FlowSync?

FlowSync gives AI coding agents — GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Claude — **persistent project memory** via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

Your agent calls `log_context` to record *why* it made a decision, and `search_context` to recall what the team decided weeks ago. Five MCP tools turn your agent from a stateless autocomplete into a teammate that **remembers everything**.

For developers who don't use an AI agent, FlowSync also auto-captures context from every `git push` as a built-in fallback.

## 🚨 The Problem

AI coding agents are powerful but **stateless** — they lose all project context between sessions. Traditional tools can't fix this:

| Tool | Limitation |
|------|------------|
| **Git Logs** | Stores *what* changed, not *why* |
| **Documentation** | Requires manual updates; goes stale quickly |
| **AI Assistants** | No persistent memory across sessions |
| **Chat history** | Fragmented, unsearchable, per-user |

---

## ✅ How FlowSync Works

### 1. 🤖 Agent Logs — *`log_context`*
After completing a task, your AI agent calls `log_context` to record the decisions made, risks introduced, and reasoning — structured and searchable. This is FlowSync's **core value**: capturing the *why* behind code, not just the *what*.

### 2. 🔍 Agent Searches — *`search_context`*
Before starting work, your agent calls `search_context` with a natural-language question like *"what did we decide about auth?"* — and gets a grounded answer with source citations, powered by Titan Embeddings + Nova Pro RAG.

### 3. 📡 Auto-Capture Fallback — *Git Push*
For developers who don't use an AI agent, a post-push hook automatically sends diffs to **Amazon Bedrock (Nova Pro)** which extracts decisions, risks, tasks, and affected files. The project brain grows either way.

### 👥 Team Visibility*
Any team member can view the context timeline, chat with the project brain, or ask natural language questions from the web dashboard — no AI agent required.

## ✨ Key Features

- **`log_context` MCP Tool** — AI agent records decisions, risks, reasoning, and tasks after every unit of work
- **`search_context` MCP Tool** — AI agent queries project history with natural language; gets grounded, citation-backed answers
- **5 MCP Tools Total** — `get_project_context`, `get_recent_changes`, `search_context`, `log_context`, `get_events` — works with Copilot, Cursor, Claude
- **Auto-Capture Fallback** — Every git push triggers AI extraction via Nova Pro; project brain grows even without an AI agent
- **Strict Traceability & Source Citations** — Every AI insight is linked back to its originating commit or logged context, preventing hallucinations
- **Team Dashboard** — Real-time timeline of decisions, risks, and tasks across all branches and contributors

## 🔄 Process Flow

```
1. Agent works on task  →  2. Agent calls log_context   →  3. Context stored in Project Brain
        ↑                                                           ↓
6. Team views dashboard   ←  5. RAG answers with citations  ←  4. Agent calls search_context

                  ── Fallback: git push auto-captures diffs ──
```

**Key Actors:**
- **AI Agent** — Primary user; logs decisions via `log_context`, queries via `search_context`
- **Developer** — Codes normally; pushes trigger auto-capture as fallback
- **Team Lead / Member** — Views dashboard, chats with project brain

## 💰 Estimated Cost

| Component | AWS Service | Monthly Cost |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| Intent Extraction | Amazon Bedrock (Nova Pro) | ~₹420 ($5.00) |
| Chat & Q&A | Amazon Bedrock (Nova Lite) | ~₹85 ($1.00) |
| Embeddings | Amazon Titan Embeddings | ~₹84 ($1.00) |
| Compute | AWS Lambda | <₹170 ($2.00) |
| Storage | Amazon DynamoDB | ~₹420 ($5.00) |
| API & Network | Amazon API Gateway | ~₹265 ($3.15) |
| **Total** | | **~₹1,400 ($17.00) / month** |

> **~₹350 ($4.00) per developer per month** (4-person team)

### Why it's cost-effective:
- **Zero Idle Cost** — Serverless architecture means you pay ₹0 when the team isn't coding
- **High ROI** — Saving just a couple of hours of confusion per month makes it pay for itself
- **Linear Scalability** — Costs grow linearly with team activity, no sudden tier jumps

---

## �️ Why This Architecture

### DynamoDB over RDS
FlowSync ingests unpredictable bursts of developer events — spiky, bursty, schema-light workloads that would thrash a relational DB. DynamoDB delivers **single-digit millisecond reads** at any scale, and PAY_PER_REQUEST means **₹0 idle cost** overnight when teams aren't coding. A JOIN-heavy RDS instance would sit idle burning reserved capacity.

### Lambda over EC2 / ECS
There is no sustained load — events arrive in bursts during working hours then go silent. Lambda scales to **zero between events** and to **hundreds of concurrent executions** during a commit storm. EC2 or ECS would require capacity planning, health checks, and a baseline bill even at rest.

### Model Tiering — Nova Pro → Nova Lite
`us.amazon.nova-pro-v1:0` is used only for **high-value, once-per-commit intent extraction** where accuracy matters. `us.amazon.nova-lite-v1:0` handles **interactive chat and Q&A** where latency matters. This splits cost and latency: Pro costs ~4× more; routing cheaper queries to Lite cuts the AI bill by ~60% for typical usage.

### Async Ingestion Pipeline
The ingestion Lambda stores the raw event to DynamoDB immediately (200 ms latency), then fires `invokeAsync` to the AI processing Lambda. The developer's push hook gets an instant `200 OK` and is never blocked waiting on Bedrock. AI processing happens in the background within seconds.

### S3 Archival for Query Audit
Every raw event payload is also archived to S3 (`flowsync-raw-*`). This provides a **full audit trail** for debugging, compliance, and potential future ML training — at roughly ₹1.7/GB/month with no compute cost.

### API Gateway over ALB
API Gateway provides **built-in rate limiting, per-client API keys, request validation, and TLS termination** — all configured with a single CDK resource. An ALB would require a separate WAF, custom auth Lambda, and manual cert rotation.

### Titan Embeddings for RAG
Amazon Titan Text Embeddings v1 is **natively integrated** with Bedrock, requires no external vector DB, and stores 1,536-dimension embedding arrays directly in DynamoDB beside the context item. This eliminates the operational overhead of running a separate Pinecone or pgvector instance.

### Scrypt over Bcrypt for Token Hashing
Project API tokens are hashed with `scrypt` (N=16384, r=8, p=1). Scrypt is **memory-hard** (not just CPU-hard like bcrypt), making GPU-based brute-force attacks ~100× more expensive for an attacker, with no observable difference to the user.

- **Persistent Memory** — Unlike chat history, FlowSync stores structured, searchable project knowledge forever
- **Dual Input** — AI agent logging + automatic git push capture ensures no context is ever lost
- **Guaranteed Accountability** — Strict traceability and source citations prevent AI hallucinations about project facts
- **First of its kind** — The first system that gives AI coding agents persistent, project-wide memory via MCP

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- VS Code 1.85+
- A git repository

### 1. Install the Extension
Download `flowsync-1.0.1.vsix` from the [Releases](https://github.com/your-org/flowsync/releases) page or from the [FlowSync website](https://d2bwi2bny67wme.cloudfront.net).

```bash
code --install-extension flowsync-1.0.1.vsix
```

### 2. Initialize Your Project
Open your repo in VS Code. Click the **⚡ FlowSync** button in the status bar → **Initialize Project**.

FlowSync auto-detects your project name, languages, frameworks, and branch. You’ll receive a **Project ID** and **API Token** — save these and share the token with teammates.

### 3. Connect Your AI Agent
Your agent (Copilot, Cursor, Claude) should automatically discover 5 MCP tools: `log_context`, `search_context`, `get_project_context`, `get_recent_changes`, and `get_events`.

If not, add `.vscode/mcp.json` to your repo:
```jsonc
{
  "servers": {
    "flowsync": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["${workspaceFolder}/mcp-server/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "FLOWSYNC_PROJECT_ID": "<your-project-id>",
        "FLOWSYNC_TOKEN": "${input:flowsync-token}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Start Working
- **Your AI agent** calls `log_context` after completing tasks and `search_context` before starting new work — automatically
- **Git pushes** are auto-captured as a fallback, even without an AI agent
- **Open the dashboard** at [flowsync.site](https://d2bwi2bny67wme.cloudfront.net) with your Project ID and Token

> **Try it now:** Visit the dashboard and click “Try Demo Project” to explore a live project — no setup needed.
